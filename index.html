      <p>Monchhichi (モンチッチ) is a vintage monkey-doll hybrid born in Japan in 1974 by Sekiguchi. It’s soft, fuzzy, and sucks its thumb — yeah, a little weird. But that combo of nostalgia, creepiness, and cuteness? Totally irresistible. Monchichi became a global hit in the 80s and still lurks in the memories (and shelves) of vintage toy lovers.</p>

  <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
  <p>I first discovered Monchhichi while I was staying in Japan during the fall. I kept seeing this quirky little monkey character everywhere — in shops, on keychains, and in displays — and something about it just stood out to me. It was strange but also really cute. On Halloween, someone gave me a Monchichi coin purse, and that’s what really started it. From there, it quickly became something I connected with, and now I’ve collected several. It kind of became my thing.</p>

  <p>When I showed one to my grandma, she immediately recognized it and told me she used to have one as a kid. It was a surprising moment — I hadn’t realized Monchichi had been around that long. Seeing her light up with that memory made it even more meaningful to me. Now it’s something that connects both of us, just in different ways.</p>
